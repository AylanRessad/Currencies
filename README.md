# Currencies
Currencies is a simple Python local currency converter that uses a personal API to get real-time currency conversion for most used currencies in the world

# In order to use this program, you will need an ExchangeRatesAPI key (https://exchangeratesapi.io/) that lets you get 100 requests for free.

Executable is in releases. To make it work, simply imput the API key when prompted. After that, imput the amount that you want to convert, the currency, and the currency you want it converted to. Use the ISO currency code (Ex : USD, EUR...)
